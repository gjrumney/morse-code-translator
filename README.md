# morse-code-translator
A simple morse code translator.

Enter your message - the programme will detect whether the message is in morse or English.

A translation will be given accordingly.

**Developers Notes:**
This is the first program developed WITHOUT COPYING SOMEONE'S PROJECT! HOORAY!

Development forced me to learn what a dictionary was in Python, and how to navigate them using values instead of keys.

Lots of _for loops_ experimented with as a result, along with lists - things I hadn't had a go with really.

Also had a go at error handling, but found morse code pretty much had an answer for every special character...I'm waiting for unseen issues to arise.
